description: Converts a pocket-grinding spec into a TDD-structured execution plan of full Pocket Packets. Use when pocket-grinding handoff arrives (spec path + acceptance criteria). Trigger on "create plan", "build plan", "pocket-planning", or when pocket-grinding skill invokes this. Outputs tasks ready to dispatch via pocket-development skill.

# Pocket Planning

Bridges pocket-grinding spec and pocket-development execution. Scans codebase context, maps file structure, decomposes acceptance criteria into TDD-structured tasks, generates Pocket Packets with test-first steps and commits, then runs a spec reviewer subagent — plus a conditional test strategy audit when any Phase 6 trigger fires (cross-unit GWT scenario, ambiguous test level, persistence/concurrency/network/external-service behavior that materially changes how the task must be tested, or a `[test-risk]` task) — before handoff.

**Core principle:** Every task is red → green → refactor → commit. Steps live inside the task. Pocket enforces execution order and parallelism.

**Test boundary:** Planning owns test *intent*. Development owns test *implementation*. Packets carry test intent — never test source code (Phase 4).

## When to Use

- pocket-grinding skill has invoked this with a spec path + acceptance criteria
- User says "create plan from spec", "build execution plan", "plan this"
- A spec exists in `docs/pocket/spec/` and needs to become executable tasks

Do NOT use:
- Without a completed pocket-grinding spec (use pocket-grinding skill first)
- To re-plan a task already in execution (use pocket-development directly)

## Hard Gates

```
GATE 0: POCKET-GRINDING HANDOFF VERIFICATION.
        Before doing ANYTHING else, verify you have ALL of these:
        - [ ] Spec file path (e.g., docs/pocket/spec/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/topic.md)
        - [ ] Acceptance criteria (full GWT list)
        - [ ] Architecture constraints
        - [ ] Design decision
        - [ ] Open questions / assumptions
        If ANY is missing → STOP. "HANDOFF_INCOMPLETE: Missing [list missing items].
        Return to pocket-grinding or provide manually."
        Do NOT proceed to Phase 0 until all inputs are verified.

GATE 1: Spec must exist and be readable. Missing → ask user for correct path.

GATE 2: Acceptance criteria must be present and usable.
        Rules with GWT → use directly.
        Rules without GWT → derive behavioral assertions, mark [derived].
        No acceptance criteria at all → STOP. Return to pocket-grinding.

GATE 3: Design Decision section must be present in spec.
        Missing → STOP. "Design Decision not found. Return to pocket-grinding
        or provide the decision manually." Do not proceed to Phase 2.

GATE 4: Spec Reviewer must APPROVE before the plan is presented at the Phase 7
        approval gate.
        Issues Found → fix plan, re-run reviewer. Do not skip.
        (Phase 6 is conditional — an APPROVE is required whether or not it runs.
         If Phase 6 changes the plan, it is re-reviewed before Phase 7.)

GATE 5: User must approve the final plan before ANY downstream handoff.
        All plans hand off to pocket-structuring (which generates the execution-plan/ index and task files).
        Running `structure --dry-run` is validation only and never authorizes a handoff.
        Do not invoke pocket-structuring before the user explicitly approves.
```

## Input Requirements

Read the spec file at Phase 1. The table below is a checklist of what to extract.

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Spec path | `docs/pocket/spec/{date}-{slug}/topic.md` | Yes |
| Acceptance criteria | Spec `## Acceptance Criteria` | Yes |
| Architecture constraints | Spec `## Architecture Constraints` | Yes |
| Design decision | Spec `## Design Decision` | Yes — GATE 3 |
| Open questions / assumptions | Spec `## Open Questions` | If present |
| Out-of-scope list | Spec `## Scope → Out-of-Scope` | Yes |
| Dependencies | Spec `## Dependencies` | If present |
| Rollback plan | Spec `## Rollback Plan` | If present |

---

## Phase 0: Preflight

**Goal:** Gather context BEFORE parsing the spec. Prevents planning against stale or incomplete understanding.

### Codebase Scan

In Phase 0, read only the `## Context → Related Areas` section of the spec to identify which codebase files to scan. Do NOT read the full spec here — that happens in Phase 1.

Scan identified areas:
- Read the codebase files listed under Related Areas
- Check recent commits in affected paths: `git log --oneline -10 -- <path>`
- Identify existing test patterns: framework, naming conventions, folder layout
- Identify existing file conventions: module boundaries, error handling, logging
- Search for existing shared helpers/utilities the plan can reuse — glob for helper-style
  names (`*util*`, `*helper*`, `lib/`, `shared/`) AND grep for exported symbols used across
  files in the related feature areas, since domain-scoped helpers rarely carry "util" in
  their filename — tasks must import these instead of reinventing them

**Test framework gate:** If zero test files exist in the codebase:
→ STOP. Ask user: "No test files found. Confirm the test framework to use (e.g., pytest, Jest, go test, RSpec) before continuing."
→ Store the answer explicitly in Preflight Summary as `Test framework: <user-specified>`.
Do not proceed until test framework is confirmed.

### Library Docs Search

For every unfamiliar dependency in the spec's tech stack or architecture constraints, and every dependency listed in the spec's `## Dependencies` section (existing to leverage + newly proposed):
- Use context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id` then `query-docs`) to fetch current docs
- Focus on: API usage, version-specific behavior, known constraints, test utilities
- Do NOT skip this for libraries not in your training data — query them

**context7 fallback:** If `resolve-library-id` returns no results or `query-docs` returns empty:
→ Note the library in Preflight Summary under "Unknown areas: <library name> <version> — docs unavailable"
→ Do NOT block Phase 1 on unresolvable library docs
→ Flag in QUALITY BAR of every Pocket Packet that uses this library: "Library docs unavailable — verify API usage carefully"

### Preflight Summary

```
PREFLIGHT COMPLETE
Codebase scanned: <areas reviewed>
Test framework: <framework + conventions found, or user-specified>
File conventions: <key patterns>
Existing helpers: <reusable helper/util modules found, or none>
Library docs fetched: <list of libraries queried>
Key findings: <anything surprising or constraining for the plan>
Unknown areas: <gaps — missing docs, unreadable files, etc.>
```

---

## Phase 1: Parse Spec

**Goal:** Extract all necessary context. Surface problems before decomposition starts.

Read spec completely, extract:

1. **Feature name** — from spec title
2. **Context summary** — current state, problem, related areas
3. **Design decision** — chosen option + tradeoffs → GATE 3 fires if missing
4. **Architecture constraints** — layers, patterns, forbidden dependencies
5. **Acceptance criteria** — every rule + its GWT scenarios
6. **Out-of-scope items** — enforced in every Pocket Packet's QUALITY BAR
7. **Open questions / assumptions** — propagated as risks in QUALITY BAR
8. **Rollback plan** — propagated into STOP CONDITIONS of affected tasks

### GWT Check
- Rules with GWT → use directly
- Rules without GWT → note as `[N rules missing GWT — derive in Phase 3]`
- Negative rules (must-not) → note as `[N negative rules — need inverted assertions]`

### Conflict Check
- Duplicate rules (same behavior, different wording) → flag `[DUPLICATE]`, merge
- Rule conflicts out-of-scope (`must-have` vs `must-not-touch`) → flag `[CONTRADICTION]`, stop and ask user

### SPEC PARSED Summary

```
SPEC PARSED: <feature name>
Design: <chosen option>
Constraints: <key constraints>
Rules: <N> | GWT coverage: <M> with GWT, <K> need derivation, <J> negative
Open questions: <N>
Rollback plan: present | absent
Conflicts: none | <description>
```

---

## Phase 2: File Structure Mapping

**Goal:** Map files to create or modify before task decomposition. Locks in boundaries.

For every acceptance criteria rule, identify:

```
Rule: <rule name>
  Create: exact/path/to/new-file.ext        ← new files
  Modify: exact/path/to/existing.ext:L1-L2  ← existing files + line range if known
  Test:   tests/exact/path/to/test.ext      ← test file (new or existing)
```

**File mapping rules:**
- Each file must have one clear responsibility — no generic catch-alls (`utils.ts`, `helpers.py`)
- When 2+ mapped files need the same logic, plan a named, domain-scoped helper module
  (e.g. `auth/token-utils.ts`) as an explicit Create entry — do not inline duplicates.
  Reuse helpers found in Preflight before creating new ones.
- Files that change together should live together (by feature, not by layer)
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns unless the file is already unwieldy —
  a mapped Modify file already over ~300 lines (or pushed past it by this work) → plan the
  extraction as part of the task and add the extracted file(s) to this map
- Every non-trivial implementation file must have a corresponding test file listed
- Exact paths — no relative paths, no `src/*/...` wildcards

This map directly informs Phase 3 decomposition. No task may touch files not listed here without a reason explained in its Pocket Packet.

---

## Phase 3: Decompose → Tasks

**Goal:** Map rules + file structure into bounded tasks with recommended execution order.

### Decomposition Rules

**Rule 1 — One task = one bounded deliverable**
Correctly sized: one subagent can complete it without waiting for another. Two separate areas with no shared dependency → split.

**Rule 2 — Steps live inside the task**
Sequential work (create → implement → test) → numbered steps in OBJECTIVE. Not separate tasks. Steps are instructions, not delegation units.

**Rule 3 — Scaffolding is always its own task**
Project init, schema, shared interfaces → own task marked `[prereq]`. Never bundle with feature work.

**Rule 4 — One rule can spawn multiple tasks**
Work across distinct layers, independent modules, or separately verifiable deliverables → split. Backend + frontend, service + event handler, DB schema + cache layer. Both tasks reference the same rule's GWT.
For cross-layer patterns → `references/task-decomposition.md`

**Rule 5 — Task scope must be explicit**
Name files, modules, functions in scope. "Implement streaming" is invalid. Infer from file map if spec doesn't specify.

**Rule 6 — Cross-unit scenarios get explicit integration verification**
A GWT scenario that only holds when 2+ units collaborate (service + repository, producer + consumer, API + client) gets its verification decided here, not discovered mid-execution.

> Independently useful and runnable once its dependencies complete?
> YES → own integration-test task, `[depends: T_a, T_b]`. NO → extra TDD cycle inside the owning task.

Either way it lands in some task's Step 1 test intent — a cross-unit scenario verified nowhere is a defect the Spec Reviewer flags.

### Rule 2 vs Rule 4 Tiebreaker
> Is the second piece verifiable and useful without the first?
> YES → two tasks. NO → one task with sequential steps.

### Conflict Resolution
- Overlapping rules: check if same behavior (merge) or genuinely distinct (keep, note shared precondition)
- Unclear → stop, ask user before generating packets

### Dependency Notation

```
[prereq]           — no dependencies, runs first
[depends: T1]      — must wait for T1 to complete
[depends: T1, T2]  — must wait for both
[parallel: T3]     — can run concurrently with T3
[test-risk]        — marker: this task's test strategy is non-obvious (Phase 6 trigger)
```

Dependency annotations are **recommended order** — pocket-development enforces actual sequencing. Communicate this to user in Phase 7.

`[test-risk]` is a marker, not a dependency — always append it **after** a dependency annotation (`### Task 4: Sync worker retry policy [depends: T2] [test-risk]`). Used alone it carries no dependency and parses into the depth-0 prereq tier, silently reordering execution.

### Circular Dependency Check
Walk each task's dependency chain before presenting. If any chain leads back to itself → resolve by removing artificial dependency or extracting a `[prereq]` task.

### Large Spec (10+ tasks)
Ask user: "This spec produces N tasks — recommend batching into phases for manageability. Proceed as one plan or split into Phase A (foundation), Phase B (features), Phase C (integration)?"

### Task List

```
TASK LIST — <feature name>
Total: <N> tasks | Dependency order is recommended — pocket-development enforces execution

T1: <name> [prereq]
T2: <name> [depends: T1]
T3: <name> [depends: T1] [parallel: T4]
...

Parallelizable groups:
  After T1: T2, T3 can run concurrently
```

For advanced patterns (shared interfaces, event-driven, phased rollouts):
→ Load `references/task-decomposition.md` — **mandatory if spec produces 4+ tasks**

---

## Phase 4: Generate Pocket Packets

**Goal:** Write a complete 7-field Pocket Packet per task. Every packet includes TDD steps and a commit step.

**No Placeholders rule:** Every step must contain what the agent actually needs. These are plan failures:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without specifying what to test)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the content — agents may execute tasks out of order)
- Code steps without code

### Test Intent, Not Test Code

Every behavioral task carries seven fields across the RED cycle — **test file, level, GWT test intent, boundary to exercise, test doubles, expected RED reason** in Step 1, and the **exact command** in Step 2 where the test is actually run. Both steps are laid out in the template below; the command is defined once, in Step 2.

Do **not** write test source code into the plan. The implementation does not exist yet, so code here is false precision: it pins imports, signatures, and fixture shapes that may legitimately change while still satisfying the spec. The implementer writes the test during the RED step, against the API that exists by then. The seven fields are what let them do that without guessing.

### Spec → Pocket Packet Mapping

| Pocket Field | Source |
|---|---|
| OBJECTIVE | Rule + TDD steps (red → green → refactor) + commit |
| REFERENCES LOADED | Spec path + preflight codebase files read |
| WHY THIS APPROACH | Task type → complexity assessment |
| SANDWICH CONTEXT | Architecture constraints + design decision |
| DELIVERABLE | GWT scenarios (or derived) from acceptance criteria |
| QUALITY BAR | Must-haves, must-not-haves, open question risks |
| STOP CONDITIONS | Done = GWT passes + tests green | Escalate = constraint breach |

### Pocket Packet Template

````markdown
---
### Task N: <task name> [dependency notation]
---

## OBJECTIVE
<Single bounded deliverable — what MUST be done, not how>

Files:
- Create: `exact/path/new-file.ext`
- Modify: `exact/path/existing.ext`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/test.ext`

Steps:
1. Write failing test for: <acceptance criteria rule / GWT scenario name>
   Test file: `tests/exact/path/test.ext`
   Level: unit | integration | E2E

   Test intent:
   Given <precondition>
   When <action>
   Then:
   - <observable outcome>
   - <observable outcome>

   Exercise through:
   - <public entry point / boundary — not internals>

   Test doubles:
   - mock/fake: <external dep>
   - do NOT mock: <the unit under test>

   Expected RED:
   - <why it fails today — missing function, or behavior currently allowed>

2. Run test — verify FAIL:
   `<exact command with flags>`
   Expected failure: <specific error or assertion failure message>

3. Implement minimal code to satisfy the test:
   File: `exact/path/file.ext`
   Implement: <specific function/class/module — no more than needed>

4. Run test — verify PASS:
   `<exact command>`
   Expected: PASS

5. Refactor while green (bounded):
   - Rule of three: same logic appears 3+ times in the files in scope → extract a named,
     domain-scoped helper (e.g. `auth/token-utils.ts`) — never a generic `utils.ts`
   - A modified file crosses ~300 lines, or a function exceeds ~50 lines → split/extract
   - Refactor only within task-scope files plus helper files declared in the file map
   - Re-run test: `<exact command>` — must stay PASS
   - The auditor judges the refactor heuristics from the diff; no implementer self-report is required or accepted. A diff violating none of the thresholds proceeds to commit

6. Commit:
   `git add exact/path/file.ext tests/exact/path/test.ext`
   `git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>"`
   Valid types: `feat | fix | test | refactor | chore`
   Scope = module or feature name from spec (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT validation`)
   If Step 5 extracted a helper, commit it separately as `refactor(<scope>): <description>`

[Add additional test→implement→refactor→commit cycles if rule has multiple GWT scenarios]

**Non-testable tasks** (scaffold, directory creation, config setup — no behavioral GWT):
Replace Steps 1–6 with:
1. Create the structure / file / config
2. Verify: `<exact validation command, e.g., ls -la, config lint, or startup check>`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "chore(<scope>): <description>"`
Mark in QUALITY BAR: `[no-tdd — structural task]`

## REFERENCES LOADED
<spec path> — rule: <rule name>, GWT scenarios used as verification
<codebase file from preflight> — <what was learned about existing patterns>
[CRITICAL: Without this section, packet is incomplete]

## WHY THIS APPROACH
Justification: <specific reason — file count + reasoning depth>
Complexity: <lightweight | standard | deep>

## SANDWICH CONTEXT
[CRITICAL: <hard constraint that, if violated, requires full redo>]
You are implementing <task name> for <feature name>.
Spec: <spec path>
Design decision: <chosen option, 1 line>
Files in scope: <explicit list from Phase 2 file map — no other files>
Test framework: <framework + conventions from preflight>
Available after: <dependencies>
Architecture rule: <forbidden dependency or must-use pattern>
[RESTATE: <same hard constraint from first line>]

## DELIVERABLE
Verification — task is DONE when all pass:

Given <precondition>, When <action>, Then <outcome>
Given <edge case>, When <action>, Then <outcome>
[derived] Given <inferred precondition>, When <action>, Then <outcome>
[must-not] Given <condition>, When <action>, Then system must NOT <forbidden outcome>

All tests PASS. Commit exists with message matching `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.

Format: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED

## QUALITY BAR
Must-have:
  - <acceptance criteria item>
  - Tests written BEFORE implementation (TDD — not after)
  - Rule of three enforced — no logic left duplicated 3+ times in the files in scope (enforcement verified by the auditor from the diff, not asserted by the implementer)
  - Commit message follows conventional commits format

Must-not-have:
  - <out-of-scope item from spec>
  - Skipping the failing test step (implement-then-test is a plan violation)
  - Modifications to files outside the listed scope

Open question risks:
  - <unresolved assumption> → if wrong: report NEEDS_CONTEXT immediately

Rollback note:
  - <rollback condition from spec if relevant>

## STOP CONDITIONS
Done when: all DELIVERABLE scenarios pass, tests green, commit created
Uncertain when: <open question assumption proves wrong>
Escalate when: <constraint violated> or <task touches out-of-scope files>
````

### SANDWICH CONTEXT — Constraint Selection

`[CRITICAL]` and `[RESTATE]` only for constraints that, if violated, require full redo:
- Forbidden dependencies from `## Architecture Constraints`
- Must-use patterns (e.g., "all DB access through repository interface")
- Layer boundaries (e.g., "domain must not import infrastructure")

Do NOT fill with style preferences or naming conventions.

### GWT Derivation (rules without scenarios)
1. Identify precondition, trigger, outcome from rule text
2. Write: `Given <precondition>, When <action>, Then <outcome>`
3. Mark `[derived — no GWT in spec]`
4. Add one failure case: `Given <invalid input>, When <action>, Then <error>`

### Negative Criteria (must-not rules)
1. `[must-not] Given <condition>, When <action>, Then system must NOT <outcome>`
2. Also write the enforcement: `Given <condition>, When <action>, Then <system blocks/rejects>`

### Complexity Selection

| Task Type | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Scaffold, file creation | Lightweight | Minimal reasoning, clear output |
| Single module, clear spec (1–3 files) | Lightweight | Straightforward implementation |
| Multi-file with judgment | Standard | Requires cross-file coordination |
| Complex integration, new patterns | Standard | Novel patterns or unclear boundaries |
| Architecture decisions | Deep | High judgment, broad impact |
| Review / audit | Read-only review | Independent verification |

**Override:** File count is starting point. Branching logic, error handling decisions, or ambiguous spec → promote to Standard.

---

## Phase 5: Spec Reviewer

**Goal:** Verify plan covers the spec completely, carries usable test intent, and has no placeholder failures. Dispatch subagent, wait for result before continuing.

→ Load `references/spec-reviewer-prompt.md` for the full dispatch prompt.

Quick dispatch format:

```
Dispatch: Subagent reviewer | Standard complexity
Plan file: docs/pocket/plans/{date}-{slug}/execution-plan.md
Spec file: docs/pocket/spec/{date}-{slug}/topic.md
Return: Status (Approved | Issues Found) + specific issues with task:step references
```

**Gate 4 enforcement (maximum 2 review cycles):**
- Status = Approved → proceed to Phase 6 (run its trigger check)
- Status = Issues Found → fix issues inline, re-dispatch reviewer (cycle 2)
- Cycle 2 still Issues Found → STOP. Output:
  ```
  REVIEW BLOCKED — <N> unresolved issues after 2 cycles:
  <reviewer's Issues list verbatim>
  ```
  Ask user: "Please resolve the above before the plan can be presented for approval."
  Do not auto-advance to Phase 6 or Phase 7.
- Full reviewer dispatch protocol → `references/spec-reviewer-prompt.md`

---

## Phase 6: Test Strategy Audit (conditional — skipped by default)

**Goal:** Catch test-strategy mistakes the Spec Reviewer cannot see. Never generates test code, never rewrites the plan. **Default is SKIP.**

### Trigger Check (always run — it is free)

Dispatch only if one or more holds:

1. A GWT scenario spans 2+ implementation units (Rule 6 fired in Phase 3)
2. The unit vs integration vs E2E boundary is genuinely ambiguous for some task
3. Persistence, concurrency, networking, or an external service materially changes how a task must be tested
4. A task carries the `[test-risk]` marker

No trigger → record `TEST STRATEGY AUDIT: skipped — no trigger fired`, go to Phase 7, do not load the reference.

Trigger fires → load `references/test-strategy-audit-prompt.md`.

```
Dispatch: Subagent test-strategy-audit | Read-only review
Input: plan draft + spec + preflight findings + which triggers fired, on which tasks
Return: FINDINGS ONLY — missing behavior/edge case, wrong test level,
        wrong mock/fake boundary, missing integration verification,
        TDD ordering violation. No test code. No rewritten plan.
```

Apply findings by editing affected tasks in place. Then, before Phase 7:

- Task added → re-run the Phase 3 circular dependency check, refresh the Phase 2 file map, and update `**Total tasks:**`, the `Recommended Order` and `Parallelizable Groups` blocks, and the Plan Summary table. A new task changes the topology; stale overview blocks contradict the packets.
- **The confirmation review is triggered by mutation, not by the audit having run.** `Clean` → nothing changed → skip it → Phase 7. `Findings` applied → re-dispatch the Spec Reviewer on the changed tasks, since Gate 4 covers the plan the user actually sees. When it runs it is a **single confirmation cycle, independent of Phase 5's 2-cycle budget**: Issues Found → fix inline, re-dispatch once → still Issues Found → `REVIEW BLOCKED`, stop.

---

## Phase 7: Output Execution Plan

**Goal:** Save the plan, validate it parses, then get user approval and route to exactly one downstream skill.

### Step 1: Save the plan

Save plan to: `docs/pocket/plans/{date}-{slug}/execution-plan.md`

→ Load `references/plan-template.md` for the full execution plan document format.

### Step 2: Validate via dry-run (MANDATORY, non-authorizing)

Run the CLI against the **saved** path to confirm the plan parses, conforms to the
`### Task N: name [annotation]` template, has a valid dependency order, and to capture
the execution flow — **without writing any files**:

```bash
npx -y pocketto-pi structure "docs/pocket/plans/{date}-{slug}/execution-plan.md" --dry-run --json --contract 2
```

Parse the JSON envelope — do not scrape prose:
- **`ok == false`** → **STOP. Do not present the approval gate.** Report `error.message` to the
  user (e.g. `NO_TASKS`, `UNKNOWN_TASK_REF`, `CYCLE_DETECTED` — the plan is malformed or has a
  bad/cyclic dependency). Fix the plan, then re-run this step.
- **`ok == true`** → capture `data.action` (`"single"` | `"split"`) and `data.executionFlow`
  (the run-order graph, e.g. `T1→T2,T3(PARALLEL)→T4`). This dry-run writes nothing and never
  authorizes a handoff — it only validates. Routing does not branch on `data.action`; every
  approved plan goes to pocket-structuring.

### Step 3: Plan approval

This gate is **plan approval**: the user authorizes generation of derived execution
artifacts (`execution-plan/index.md`, task files, and phase manifests when multi-phase).
It does **not** authorize implementation. Structuring will ask separately for
**execution approval** before pocket-development starts.

Present the result, showing the execution flow:

> "Plan complete — N tasks, TDD-structured, spec-reviewed, test intent defined.
> Test strategy audit: skipped (no trigger) | run on <tasks> — Clean, no findings | run on <tasks> — <N> findings applied, changed tasks re-reviewed.
> Saved to docs/pocket/plans/…
> Execution flow: {data.executionFlow}
> Plan approval: Ready to hand off to pocket-structuring for execution index generation?"

Wait for confirmation. Apply any changes requested (re-run Step 2 if the plan changed).

### Step 4: Route to pocket-structuring (MANDATORY)

**DO NOT STOP AFTER PLAN APPROVAL.** Invoke `pocket-structuring` with:
- Execution plan path: `docs/pocket/plans/{date}-{slug}/execution-plan.md`
- Task count (from Phase 3)
- Spec file path

pocket-structuring re-parses the plan from disk and decomposes it into `execution-plan/index.md` + per-task files.

## Reference Triggers

| Reference | When to Load |
|-----------|--------------|
| `references/task-decomposition.md` | Phase 3: **mandatory if 4+ tasks** — run Over-Split/Under-Split. Also: shared interfaces, event-driven, phased rollouts |
| `references/plan-template.md` | Phase 7: writing full execution plan document |
| `references/spec-reviewer-prompt.md` | Phase 5: dispatching spec reviewer subagent |
| `references/test-strategy-audit-prompt.md` | Phase 6: **only when a trigger fires** — dispatching the conditional test strategy audit |
